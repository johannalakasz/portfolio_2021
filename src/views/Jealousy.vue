    <h2>Project description</h2>
    <div class='desc'>What initially was a 1st semester color theory assignment based on the theme of jealousy and specifically the Jealousy music video by the Korean band, Monsta X, has eventually turned into my first all-rounder fashion project. Iâ€™ve been interested in making my own clothes for a few years now, but only gotten seriously immersed in the fashion industry, the process of fashion design and sewing very recently. <br>
    <br>This project focuses on the creation of a smart blouse, inspired by stage outfits previously worn by Monsta X and on a combination of feminine and masculine silhouettes.
